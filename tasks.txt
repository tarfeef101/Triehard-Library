Notes/To Do:

1) replace sending in strings of binary and lengths with:
	a) only should need source2 for binary data, no need to not have the functionality it provides (replaced source1 with in-progress build, source3 with a base-10 in-progress)
	b) any source should allow no length being provided, just a string (done in source1 with vectors)
	c) one source should allow storage of ASCII strings, converting to binary in the backend
	d) want a measure of compression (done in source1)
		i) formula: nodes vs nodes in a normal trie
		ii) formula: nodes vs total binary characters of all strings being stored (raw)
2) error handling
	a) throw error for deleting stuff that's not there
	b) check/handle (and throw) when you cannot allocate space to do an operation
	c) throw error for invalid input to functions
		i) invalid characters in strings

for source3: can put a goto into insert to skip checking if pos==val[i] since we set it at the start
for source3: bool isLeaf() can be handled by setting a flag during inserts/deletions, that way we don't need to calculate
