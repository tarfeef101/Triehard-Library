Notes/To Do:

1) replace sending in strings of binary and lengths with:
	c) one source should allow storage of ASCII strings, converting to binary in the backend
2) error handling
	a) throw error for deleting stuff that's not there
	b) check/handle (and throw) when you cannot allocate space to do an operation
	c) throw error for invalid input to functions
		i) invalid characters in strings

for source3: bool isLeaf() can be handled by setting a flag during inserts/deletions, that way we don't need to calculate
(Not worth due to limited use, but higher storage cost)

Summary:
Source1 is binary
Source2 is soure1 but worse
Source3 is decimal
